# Horse Race Game

Horserace is a drinking game using playing cards that is inspired by horse racing. Participants bet amounts of alcohol on one of four aces, much like bettors would bet money on horses at a racing track. Instead of alcohol this implementation allows 4 players to play against each other by using virtual coins.
